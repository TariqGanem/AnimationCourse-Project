- About:

This is a snake game, the goal of it so eat all the enemies (bouncing balls in our case) in order to beat the game.

Each time you beat a level (means eating all balls in the board), you get a level up with a new velocity to your snake and a new velocity to your balls(enemies).

We used the IrrKlang sound engine for a little bit of fun, included the followed items:
  - Background music
	- Eating a bouncing ball sound effect
	- Leveling up sound effect
  - Bouncing sound effect

You can use your mouse in order to click on the balls you want the snake to eat!

The hardest thing was adjusting the camera itself. We didn't fully implement it as requested :(
